# GSM- Based Prepaid Electricity Meter with Theft Detection using Arduino ATMEGA
 - This project aims to develop a GSM-Based Prepaid Electricity Meter with Theft Detection using Arduino ATMEGA. It offers an improved the concept for the current electricity payment system by allowing the users to recharge the device and update their balance similar to mobile phone recharges. Through a simple SMS, the users can easily recharge their electricity balance using this system. Additionally, it can automatically disconnect the home power supply if the balance is low or zero. The system also provides the updates to the user's mobile phone, such as low balance alerts, cut-off alerts, resume alerts, and recharge alerts. Furthermore, it incorporates an anti-theft feature to detect attempts of meter tampering or theft. This project is valuable because it introduces a more convenient and efficient way of managing electricity payments. To provides users with greater control over their electricity consumption and allows them to stay informed about their balance and energy usage. The anti-theft alert feature adds an additional layer of security to safe the electricity meter.
